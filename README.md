# EP Hacker

Instructions to run:

1. Install tesseract OCR.
2. Install Python.
3. pip install pytesseract pyautogui pdfminer keyboard
4. Download the PDF in the largest paper size because EP has a bug where it puts it all on one page, meaning if you using something like A4 it'll cut off most of the words. Print the PDF in something like A0. Filename input.pdf in this directory.
5. Run `run.py`.
